The project aims to develop a robust spam SMS detection system using natural language processing techniques. Its objectives include:

  ->Building a dataset of labeled SMS messages for training and testing purposes.
  ->Preprocessing the text data to extract relevant features and standardize the input format.
  ->Training and fine-tuning NLP models,          such as text classifiers or sequence models, to recognize spam patterns.
  ->Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  ->Iteratively refining the models to enhance their accuracy and effectiveness in detecting spam SMS messages.
